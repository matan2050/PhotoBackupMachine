# PhotoBackupMachine

Repository for a little app that automatically backing up photos from one folder
to another folder. The process checks the 'date created' attribute for all images,
and automatically creates a new folder for that month-year pair (if non existant).
The image is copied to that folder and not deleted from the original folder
